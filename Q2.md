# Arrays and Linked lists:

---

## **1. Memory Allocation**

### **Arrays**
- Memory gets allocated in a **contiguous form** (in a single block).
- Size becomes **fixed** at the time of declaration and does not change dynamically.

### **Linked Lists**
- Memory gets allocated in a **non-contiguous manner** (nodes are scattered in memory).
- Size is **flexible** and grows or shrinks according to requirement.

**Key Difference**: Arrays use contiguous memory, while linked lists use non-contiguous memory.

## **2. Performance**

### **Arrays**
- **Access Time**: O(1) for accessing elements by index (direct access).
- **Search Time**: O(n) for unsorted arrays (linear search).

### **Linked Lists**
- **Access Time**: O(n) for accessing elements by index (traversal required).
- **Search Time**: O(n) for unsorted linked lists (linear search).

**Key Difference**: Arrays provide quicker access, while linked lists are slower due to traversal.

## **3. Insertion and Deletion**

### **Arrays**
- **Insertion**:
  - At the end: O(1) provided space is free.
  - At the beginning/middle: O(n) (elements must be shifted).
- **Deletion**:
  - At the end: O(1).
  - At the beginning/middle: O(n) (elements must be shifted).

### **Linked Lists**
- **Insertion**:
  - At the beginning: O(1) (update head pointer).
  - At the end: O(1), provided tail pointer is maintained; otherwise, O(n).
  - In the middle: O(n) (traversal required).
- **Deletion**:
  - At the beginning: O(1) (update head pointer).
  - At the end: O(1), if tail pointer is maintained; otherwise, O(n).
  - In the middle: O(n) (traversal required).

**Key Difference**: Linked lists are more efficient for insertions/deletions at the beginning and middle, while arrays are better for insertions/deletions at the end.
